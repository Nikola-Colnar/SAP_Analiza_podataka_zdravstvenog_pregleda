This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
```{r}
# Uƒçitavanje podataka iz csv datoteke:
healthDATA.modif = read.csv("Health Screening Data.csv")
View(healthDATA.modif)
total = 0

weird = 0
for (p in healthDATA.modif$ap_hi) {
  if (p < 50) {
    weird = weird + 1
  }
  total = total + 1
}
weird / total

```
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
